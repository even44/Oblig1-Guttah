            About: a short report
        </h1>
            <p>
                We started by discussing how we would like the structure of our page to look like. At first, we sketched the 
                layout of the different pages with pen and paper and agreed upon a general layout with room for improvement 
                at later stages of the development. Our group decided quickly that we wanted one homepage and three subpages 
                (CV, Portfolio and about). What all these four pages would have in common is that there would be a uniform 
                top-bar that works as a menu for easy navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                We first developed the top-bar that works as a navigation tool that will be universal for all pages. Here we made 
                a list that will sit at the top of the page. We removed margin, gave the list a class (ul_ top), made the links 
                float left with exception for the about link that will float right. We set the background colour for the top-bar to be
                a delightful shade of red.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted every page (except for “portfolio”) to have its content in a “card” that is centered. We achieved this 
                be placing the content in a main. With CSS we added main to have margin: auto and width: 75% to center it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In portfolio we still wanted the content to be placed in a centered card, but this time we wanted all three project 
                to be placed in a one card each. We made a div for each project and applied the same margin and width as in the other 
                pages. We gave every project separate class names so that we could adjust if the pictures would be on the left or right.
