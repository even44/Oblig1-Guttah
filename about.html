                We started by discussing how we would like the structure of our page to look like. At first, we sketched the 
                layout of the different pages with pen and paper and agreed upon a general layout with room for improvement 
                at later stages of the development. Our group decided quickly that we wanted one homepage and three subpages 
                (CV, Portfolio and about). What all these four pages would have in common is that there would be a uniform 
                top-bar that works as a menu for easy navigation.
