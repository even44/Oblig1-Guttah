        <h2>About my work</h2>
            <p>I have great experience with graphic design. It started as a interrest, 
            was lucky enough to turn it into my field of study, and hope to turn it 
            into my profession. Heres some examples of my work.</p>

            <h3>My newest project: Pusur</h3>
            <img class="picture" src="./pictures/pusur.png" alt="Pusur">
            <p>This project is inpired by the popular cartoon "Garfield". I wanted to express a 
                feeling of childhood nostalgia with a dash of artistic freedom. When someone sees 
                this artwork, I want them to ask themself "Am I an adult or a child trapped in a 
                adults body?". This was made in Microsoft paint in about 5 minutes. The meaning 
                behind this artwork on the other hand took me a lifetime to express</p>

            <h3>My most credited project: Fish</h3>
            <img class="picture" src="./pictures/fisk.png" alt="fisk">
            <p>With this project i wanted to express human vulnerability if the oceanlife didnt 
                exist. The fish in the ocean has been part of so much of human development and 
                i wanted to make i tribute to the fish that has given us food for millenia. I
                was awarded the "pat on the back" prize by my fellow groupe members for this 
                project. This project was created in Microsoft paint</p>

            <h3>My personal favorite project: The Great Snowman</h3>
            <img class="picture" src="./pictures/snowman.png" alt="snowman">
            <p>The snowman in this artwork has a dualistic meaning. Some people will associate
                the snowman with good times, christmas, childhood nostalgia and joyfull snowy
                days. Others will associate the snowman with the crippeling cold that winter
                will bring. In some way this project will bring forward the different kinds
                world views that can be found in different people. This project was created in
                Microsoft paint.
